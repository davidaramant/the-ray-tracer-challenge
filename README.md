# The Ray Tracer Challenge

WIP implementation of the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) by Jamis Buck.

Implemented using .NET Core 3 using [`Vector4`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector4?view=netcore-3.0) as the tuple primitive.  I attempted to use [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) for the supplied Cucumber tests but it seemed too cumbersome.
